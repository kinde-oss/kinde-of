# Kinde Of 

This project is our way to experimenting with Kinde's authentication features and not taking ourselves too seriously. The goal is to introduce features in Kinde progressively over the releases, building on the existing work, to eventually create something that could be completely unusable due to it's chaos and creativity. 

Note that this is not an official Kinde project and strictly for entertainment use. 

For more information about Kinde, [book a demo](https://kinde.com/product-demo/) with one of our friendly reps, check out our [website](https://kinde.com), or visit our [documentation](https://docs.kinde.com).
